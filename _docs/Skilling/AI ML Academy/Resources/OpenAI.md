Tooling:
-  **[The Azure OpenAI benchmarking tool](https://github.com/Azure/azure-openai-benchmark)** helps you test and measure the performance of your provisioned throughput deployments. These deployments give you a fixed amount of model compute, but the actual performance depends on factors like prompt size, generation size, and call rate. The tool sends test traffic to your deployment and shows you the throughput, latency, and utilization statistics. You can use it to try different traffic patterns and find the best settings for your prompt size, generation size, and PTUs.
